# Hangman

Hangman is a basic word-guessing game, built in React, in which the player tries to guess a secret word by picking letters from the alphabet. Too many wrong guesses, and a stick man is hung from the gallows, terminating the game.

## Running Hangman

You can play the game by visiting the following deployment: https://difficult-hangman.herokuapp.com

Or you can run Hangman on your own machine by following these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local system.
- Open a command line prompt, and navigate to the directory to which you downloaded the repository.
- Download and install NPM: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
- Type `npm start`
- The Hangman app should open in your default browser.

## Usage

Playing the game is fairly self-explantory. Users need to pick letters from the alphabet to guess the word concealed at the center of the screen. Clicking the `?` icon will bring up instructions, and clicking on the `x` icon will reset the game.
